## Learned Lessons in SchoolIS Project Process
This project was selected to be submitted for academic project based on a vision to implement a given solution that already implemented in a given school that we had seen, to other schools. At the early stage we were hardly discussed on the database structure and use cases of users. Even though we were try to use our previous experience in primary schools to understand the problem and the requirements, We did not go to our stakeholders(primary schools) to get understand what really the problem they struggle? what they need? How we help them?.

After making some milestones because we highly loosen our interest on it, we were ignore it for a month. And by late, the development of demo-software were started, at that time I craft a process that include objectives, deadlines, daily action planning routine. Each day there was a great and small milestones done. On some days I was doing reflection on what already I have done and insisting some useful updates. And finally it was presented to the instructor with a great nearly to done with some functionalities left.

## Conclusion
By the end I reflected on all of that mistakes and I get one to be kepping, After I init the project one month late, there was one thing that I learned from it, what I did not did in other previous projects which is enjoying the process, before that I was output driven, I did not enjoy the process, even my mind was not fully concerned on what I did, all the time thinking about the output(functionality) with out considering an optimum output, just goal driven.
